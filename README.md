Stardust Athenaeum is a Y2K-Gothic interactive web app that transforms your fleeting thoughts into a personal, drifting constellation. It's a calm-tech sanctuary for mindful reflection where nothing is ever sent to a server. Weave your memories, consult a cryptic oracle, and watch your private cosmos grow, all within your browser.
