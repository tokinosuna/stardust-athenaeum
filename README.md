*Built for the Varsity Hacks Hackathon.*

### **What is this?**

**Stardust Athenaeum** is a calm-tech sanctuary, an interactive art piece where you can capture fleeting memories and watch them become stars. It merges two aesthetics I love—gothic elegance and Y2K chaos—to create a unique space for mindful reflection. Everything is saved to your browser's local storage, meaning your cosmos is completely private and yours alone.

### **✧ Features ✧**
*   **Fragment Weaving:** Turn any text into a drifting, interactive star in a generative cosmos.
*   **The Oracle:** Get a dose of cryptic wisdom with the click of a button.
*   **Dual-Resonance Theming:** Switch between two distinct visual and atmospheric modes.
*   **Local-First Privacy:** All data is stored in `localStorage`. No servers, no tracking.
*   **Archive Export:** Save your entire collection of thoughts to a `.txt` file.

### **♱ Tech Stack ♱**
*   **Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** No frameworks, just pure, lightweight code.
*   **p5.js:** For the generative and interactive particle system that brings the starfield to life.

### **How to Run**

Since this is a self-contained vanilla JS project, you don't need any special setup.
1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Open the `index.html` file in your favorite web browser.
3.  That's it. Welcome to the Athenaeum.

### **My Hackathon Journey & Reflections**

So, here's the real story of how this came to be.

I started this with a whole universe of ideas but honestly, I spent way too much time just thinking about *what* to build. I thought I could handle everything myself, maybe even use Vroid to create some cool anime-style characters to act as guides and enhance the aesthetic. But with the deadline looming, I realized time was definitely too short for that grand vision.

I really hit the panic button with about 16 hours to go. This entire project was basically born from that panicked energy. It was a chaotic process, but also kinda amazing to see an idea come to life so quickly.

Looking back, I learned a ton. Next time, I should probably find a teammate to handle the hardcore coding, and me focusing on the aesthetic and user experience. But trying to juggle it all myself was a great experience too. It's a reminder that even a small, solo project can have a soul.

I have to stop working on it now because tomorrow is Monday and life calls, but I'm super proud of what I managed to create in such a short time. Any experience is an awesome experience. Would definitely love to better manage my time and find a team next time... tho idk where to find people xD.
